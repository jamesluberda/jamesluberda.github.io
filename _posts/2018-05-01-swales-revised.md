With Revisions and Adaptation for Classroom Use by James Luberda

The following is based upon an empirically-derived model, as described in John Swales' *Genre Analysis: English in Academic and Research Settings*, of how
“real-world” research article introductions commonly proceed. Note
that it is not a set of *rules*, but rather something of a *guide* as to
what readers of research articles and academic essays are likely to
expect (and find), a set of patterns in introductions that facilitate
their reading and comprehension. You might think of each “move” below as
a kind of verbal action—a “move” a writer will make to have a particular
effect on the reader. By constructing an introduction more or less along
these lines, you ensure your reader has enough information to follow
your essay and make use of the information it contains.

 

## Move 1    Establishing a territory

 In this opening move, the writer may do one or more of the following
 to broadly sketch out where the subject of his/her essay falls—the
 “big picture”
 
 •        Point out the importance of the general subject
 
 •        Make generalizations about the subject
 
 •        Review items of previous research
 

## Move 2    Establishing a niche

 In this move, the writer then indicates to the reader the particular
 area of the broader subject that the essay will deal with. This can be
 done using one or more of the following:
 
 •        Make a counter-claim, i.e. assert something contrary to
           expectations
 
 •        Indicate a gap in the existing research/thinking
 
 •        Raise a question about existing research/thinking
 
 •        Suggest the essay is continuing a tradition, i.e. it is
           following in the footsteps of previous research/thinking

## Move 3    Occupying the niche

 In this move, the writer then sketches out exactly what this
 particular essay will accomplish in relation to move \#2, and gives
 the reader a sense of how the essay will proceed. In general, each of
 the steps below will appear in this move, in order:
 
 •        Step 1: Outline the purpose of the essay, or state the
          research that was pursued
 
 •        Step 2: State the principal findings of the essay—what the
           reader can expect the essay/research will have accomplished for them
           by the time they get to the end
 
 •        Step 3: Indicate, roughly, the structure of the essay—what
          will appear in it and in what order
