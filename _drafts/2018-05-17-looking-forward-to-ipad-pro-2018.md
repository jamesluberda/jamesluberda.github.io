While only the first six tools are native iOS apps, I thought it worth including the three other tools that, thanks to their web interfaces, can very effectively be utilized via an iDevice, particularly in the case of RStudio and Jupyter, where visual output (i.e. plots of data) might otherwise be rendered to an X display. Throw in Dropbox for file synchronization and GitHub for SCM, and you have a pretty decent toolset (depending on what, of course, you plan to do--in my case, mostly prototyping and, well, maintaining this site).

## Honorable Mentions:
Codea, Replete
